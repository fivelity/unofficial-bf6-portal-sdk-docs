This UNOFFICIAL documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the TypeScript modding API for the BF6 Portal. It covers the core concepts of the API, the available modules and classes, and how to connect your Godot scene to your TypeScript code.

## TypeScript Mod API Documentation

The TypeScript modding API is an event-driven API that allows you to create custom game modes and logic for your Godot project. All the API functions and types are available under the `mod` namespace.

### Core Concepts

- **Event-Driven:** The API is heavily based on events. You can hook into the game's lifecycle by implementing specific functions that are called when certain events occur (e.g., `OnPlayerJoinGame`, `OnPlayerDied`).
- **`mod` Namespace:** All API functions, classes, and enums are accessible through the `mod` namespace.
- **Godot Integration:** The API is tightly integrated with the Godot scene. You can access and manipulate objects in your scene from your TypeScript code.
- **Object-Oriented:** The API is designed to be used in an object-oriented way. You can create classes to represent your game logic, player data, and UI components.

### Events

Here are some of the most commonly used events:

- `OnGameModeStarted()`: Called when the game mode starts. This is a good place to initialize your game logic.
- `OnGameModeEnding()`: Called when the game mode is about to end. This is a good place to do any cleanup.
- `OnPlayerJoinGame(player: mod.Player)`: Called when a player joins the game.
- `OnPlayerLeaveGame(player: mod.Player)`: Called when a player leaves the game.
- `OnPlayerDeployed(player: mod.Player)`: Called when a player deploys into the game world.
- `OnPlayerDied(player: mod.Player, killer: mod.Player, deathType: mod.DeathType, weaponUnlock: mod.WeaponUnlock)`: Called when a player dies.
- `OnPlayerInteract(player: mod.Player, interactPoint: mod.InteractPoint)`: Called when a player interacts with an `InteractPoint` in the scene.

### Commonly Used Functions

Here are some of the most commonly used functions:

- `mod.GetPlayer(playerId: number): mod.Player`: Returns the player with the specified ID.
- `mod.GetTeam(teamId: number): mod.Team`: Returns the team with the specified ID.
- `mod.GetHQ(objId: number): mod.HQ`: Returns the HQ with the specified `ObjId`.
- `mod.GetCapturePoint(objId: number): mod.CapturePoint`: Returns the capture point with the specified `ObjId`.
- `mod.GetAreaTrigger(objId: number): mod.AreaTrigger`: Returns the area trigger with the specified `ObjId`.
- `mod.DisplayNotificationMessage(message: mod.Message, player?: mod.Player, team?: mod.Team)`: Displays a notification message to the specified player or team.
- `mod.Teleport(player: mod.Player, position: mod.Vector, rotation: number)`: Teleports a player to the specified position and rotation.
- `mod.SpawnObject(objectType: any, position: mod.Vector, rotation: mod.Vector, scale?: mod.Vector): any`: Spawns an object in the world.
- `mod.UnspawnObject(object: any)`: Despawns an object from the world.
- `mod.Wait(seconds: number): Promise<void>`: Pauses the execution of an `async` function for the specified number of seconds.

### Utility Functions

The `modlib/index.ts` file provides a set of useful helper functions to simplify common tasks.

- `Concat(s1: string, s2: string): string`: Concatenates two strings.
- `And(...rest: boolean[]): boolean`: Returns `true` if all the boolean arguments are `true`.
- `getPlayerId(player: mod.Player): number`: A shorthand for `mod.GetObjId(player)`.
- `getTeamId(team: mod.Team): number`: A shorthand for `mod.GetObjId(team)`.
- `ConvertArray(array: mod.Array): any[]`: Converts a `mod.Array` to a standard TypeScript array.
- `FilteredArray(array: mod.Array, cond: (currentElement: any) => boolean): mod.Array`: Filters a `mod.Array` based on a condition and returns a new `mod.Array`.
- `IfThenElse<T>(condition: boolean, ifTrue: () => T, ifFalse: () => T): T`: Executes one of two functions based on a condition.
- `IsTrueForAll(array: mod.Array, condition: (element: any, arg: any) => boolean, arg: any = null): boolean`: Checks if a condition is true for all elements in a `mod.Array`.
- `IsTrueForAny(array: mod.Array, condition: (element: any, arg: any) => boolean, arg: any = null): boolean`: Checks if a condition is true for any element in a `mod.Array`.
- `SortedArray(array: any[], compare: (a: any, b: any) => number): any[]`: Sorts a TypeScript array.
- `WaitUntil(delay: number, cond: () => boolean): Promise<void>`: Waits for a condition to become true, checking periodically.

### State Management (`ConditionState`)

The `ConditionState` class helps manage state transitions, ensuring that an action is triggered only once when a condition becomes true.

- `new ConditionState()`: Creates a new condition state tracker.
- `update(newState: boolean): boolean`: Updates the state and returns `true` only on the transition from `false` to `true`.

You can get a specific `ConditionState` instance for different game objects:

- `getPlayerCondition(player: mod.Player, n: number): ConditionState`
- `getTeamCondition(team: mod.Team, n: number): ConditionState`
- `getCapturePointCondition(obj: mod.CapturePoint, n: number): ConditionState`
- `getMCOMCondition(obj: mod.MCOM, n: number): ConditionState`
- `getVehicleCondition(obj: mod.Vehicle, n: number): ConditionState`
- `getGlobalCondition(n: number): ConditionState`

### UI API

The API provides a powerful system for creating and manipulating UI widgets.

- **`mod.UIWidget`**: The base class for all UI widgets.
- **`mod.AddUIText(...)`**: Adds a text widget to the UI.
- **`mod.AddUIImage(...)`**: Adds an image widget to the UI.
- **`mod.AddUIButton(...)`**: Adds a button widget to the UI.
- **`mod.AddUIContainer(...)`**: Adds a container widget to the UI.
- **`mod.FindUIWidgetWithName(name: string): mod.UIWidget`**: Finds a UI widget by its name.
- **`mod.SetUIWidgetVisible(widget: mod.UIWidget, visible: boolean)`**: Sets the visibility of a UI widget.
- **`OnPlayerUIButtonEvent(player: mod.Player, widget: mod.UIWidget, event: mod.UIButtonEvent)`**: Event that is triggered when a player interacts with a UI button.

#### Advanced UI (`ParseUI`)

The `ParseUI` function allows you to build complex UI hierarchies from a declarative, JSON-like structure. This is the recommended way to create UIs.

**Example:**

```typescript
const myUI = ParseUI({
    type: "Container",
    name: "my_container",
    size: [500, 100],
    anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopCenter,
    children: [
        {
            type: "Text",
            name: "my_text",
            textLabel: "Hello, World!",
            size: [200, 50],
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.Center,
        },
    ],
});
```

### Messaging and Notifications

The API provides several functions for displaying messages to players.

- `ShowEventGameModeMessage(event: mod.Message, target?: mod.Player | mod.Team)`: Displays a large, central game mode message.
- `ShowHighlightedGameModeMessage(event: mod.Message, target?: mod.Player | mod.Team)`: Displays a highlighted message in the world log.
- `ShowNotificationMessage(msg: mod.Message, target?: mod.Player | mod.Team)`: Displays a standard notification message.
- `DisplayCustomNotificationMessage(msg: mod.Message, custom: mod.CustomNotificationSlots, duration: number, target?: mod.Player | mod.Team)`: Displays a notification in a custom slot for a specific duration.
- `ClearCustomNotificationMessage(custom: mod.CustomNotificationSlots, target?: mod.Player | mod.Team)`: Clears a custom notification message.
- `ClearAllCustomNotificationMessages(target: mod.Player)`: Clears all custom notification messages for a player.

## Godot Scene Connection

The connection between the Godot scene and the TypeScript code is established through the `ObjId` property.

### `ObjId`

The `ObjId` is a unique integer that you can assign to any node in your Godot scene. This ID is then used to reference the node from your TypeScript code.

To assign an `ObjId` to a node, simply add an integer property named `ObjId` to the node in the Godot editor.

### Game Logic Objects

The modding API provides a set of custom Godot nodes that you can use to create your game logic. These nodes are the bridge between the game world and your TypeScript code.

Here are some of the most commonly used game logic objects:

- **`HQ_PlayerSpawner`**: A node that defines a headquarter and its spawn points. You can get a reference to this object in your script using `mod.GetHQ(objId)`.
- **`CapturePoint`**: A node that represents a capture point. You can get a reference to this object in your script using `mod.GetCapturePoint(objId)`.
- **`AreaTrigger`**: A node that represents a trigger volume. You can get a reference to this object in your script using `mod.GetAreaTrigger(objId)`. The `OnPlayerEnterAreaTrigger` and `OnPlayerExitAreaTrigger` events are triggered when a player enters or leaves the volume.
- **`InteractPoint`**: A node that represents a point that players can interact with. The `OnPlayerInteract` event is triggered when a player interacts with the point.
- **`VehicleSpawner`**: A node that spawns vehicles. You can get a reference to this object in your script using `mod.GetVehicleSpawner(objId)`.
- **`AI_Spawner`**: A node that spawns AI soldiers. You can get a reference to this object in your script using `mod.GetSpawner(objId)`.

### Example Workflow

1. **Create a Godot Scene:** Create a new Godot scene and add the necessary game logic objects.
1. **Assign `ObjId`s:** Assign a unique `ObjId` to each game logic object that you want to access from your script.
1. **Write TypeScript Code:** Write your TypeScript code to implement your game logic. Use the `mod.Get...` functions to get references to the objects in your scene.
1. **Compile and Run:** Export your project to Portal and run the game.
